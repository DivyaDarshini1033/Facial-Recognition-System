# Face Recognition System for Tech Entrepreneurs

A deep learning based face recognition system that identifies five prominent tech industry leaders: **Jeff Bezos**, **Bill Gates**, **Elon Musk**, **Mark Zuckerberg**, and **Steve Jobs**. Built using TensorFlow and Keras, the system achieves **75-95% accuracy** on both validation data and real world images.

## Key Features
- **Custom CNN Architecture**: Three convolutional blocks with ~1.8M parameters
- **Real-World Tested**: Successfully recognizes faces from random Google images

## Dataset
- **3,000 images** total (600 per person)
- **80/20 split**: 2,400 training, 600 validation

## Training
- 30 epochs with Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss
- Batch size: 32 | Learning rate: 0.001

## Technologies
TensorFlow • Keras • OpenCV • NumPy • Matplotlib • Google Colab (GPU).
